We describe how to create good looking figures in Matlab to use
for scientific publications and reports.  Please see the github pages
branch for the published Matlab document:
* [Creating high-quality graphics in MATLAB for papers and presentations](http://dgleich.github.io/hq-matlab-figs/)
and the blog post about it
* (Coming once it's published!)
